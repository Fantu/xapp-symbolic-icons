# xapp-symbolic-icons (XSI)

A set of symbolic icons which replaces the GNOME-specific Adwaita set.

All provided icons are prefixed with xsi- and places in /usr/share/icons/hicolor.

Icon names loosely follow the Adwaita names.

To search/replace Adwaita icon names in your code, run:

`xsi-replace-adwaita-symbolic`
